# H2O Horizons ~ AI-Driven Predictive Water Resource Management System

## Overview  
This project aims to develop an **AI-Driven Predictive Water Resource Management System** designed to forecast future water demands and evaluate current and future water storage capacities. The goal is to assist policymakers in making data-driven decisions for sustainable water management.  
<br>  
The system integrates data from various sources such as historical water usage, reservoir levels, climate projections, population growth trends, and agricultural practices. By leveraging advanced machine learning and regression models, the platform predicts future water demands while considering climate variability, demographic changes, and shifts in land use.  
<br>  
In addition to predictive modeling, the system includes geospatial analysis for reservoir mapping and real-time monitoring of water infrastructure. The end result is a comprehensive tool that provides actionable insights through a user-friendly dashboard for policymakers and water resource managers.  
<br>

## Key Features  
- **Machine Learning and Regression Models**: Predict future water demand by analyzing historical and real-time data.  
- **Data Integration**: Combine data from multiple sources, including:
  - India-WRIS  
  - Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)  
  - Central Water Commission (CWC)  
  - Census of India  
  - National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)  
  - FAOSTAT  
  - Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Perform mapping of reservoirs, monitor land use patterns, and analyze infrastructure in real-time.  
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Use AWS for dynamic data collection, storage, and automated ETL pipelines for continuous data ingestion.  
- **Scenario Modeling**: Simulate extreme weather events to test water infrastructure resilience and plan for future needs.  
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly dashboard developed with React.js provides policymakers with easy-to-understand visual insights.  
- **Backend APIs**: Built with Django or Flask to manage data and model interactions.  
<br>

## Technologies Used  
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive models for water demand forecasting.  
- **Cloud Services**: AWS (S3, Lambda, etc.) for scalable infrastructure and automated data ingestion pipelines.  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping and land use analysis using GIS tools.  
- **Web Technologies**: React.js for frontend, Django/Flask for backend API development.  
- **ETL Pipelines**: Automated data pipelines for continuous integration of data from multiple sources.  
<br>

## Use Cases  
- **Water Demand Forecasting**: Predict water consumption based on climate patterns, population growth, and agricultural practices.  
- **Storage Capacity Analysis**: Assess current and future storage capacities to plan for infrastructure upgrades.  
- **Policy Recommendations**: Provide policymakers with actionable insights for sustainable water usage and storage optimization.  
- **Resilience Testing**: Stress-test water infrastructure by simulating extreme climate scenarios and future population growth.  
<br>

## Data Sources  
The system integrates data from the following key platforms:  
- **India-WRIS**: Water resources information and management platform.  
- **Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)**: Climate data and projections.  
- **Central Water Commission (CWC)**: Data on water bodies and reservoirs.  
- **Census of India**: Demographic data and population trends.  
- **National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)**: Land use data.  
- **FAOSTAT**: Agricultural statistics for evaluating water consumption.  
- **Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)**: Groundwater level and resource data.
